# graphicalboredomkiller

A very simple and stupid graphical program, written in Go using the SDL2 library.

### Why did I make this?

    - I'm making an NES emulator with GO so I wanted to practise using the SDL2 library with Go
    - I'm sick and bored (in quarantine in the barracks!)

### Why would I ever need this?

You wont. If you want to learn Go or SDL2 or both this could be a place to start.
